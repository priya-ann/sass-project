            <h3>Waterways</h3>
            <img src="img/vaporetto.jpg" alt="vaporetto">
            <p>Venice is a city of small islands, enhanced during the Middle Ages by the dredging of soils to raise the marshy ground above the tides. The resulting canals encouraged the flourishing of a nautical culture which proved central to the economy of the city. Today those canals still provide the means for transport of goods and people within the city.The classical Venetian boat is the gondola, although it is now mostly used for tourists, or for weddings, funerals, or other ceremonies, or as 'traghetti' to cross the Canale Grande in the absence of a nearby bridge. The main public transportation means in the lagoon area are motorised waterbuses (vaporetti) which ply regular routes along the Grand Canal and between the city's islands.</p>

            <p>The mainland of Venice is composed of 5 boroughs: Mestre-Carpenedo, Marghera, Chirignago-Zelarino and Favaro Veneto. Mestre is the center and the most populated urban area of the mainland of Venice. There are several bus routes and two Translohr tramway lines. Several bus routes and one of the above tramway lines link the mainland with Piazzale Roma, the main bus station in Venice, via Ponte della Libert√†, a road bridge connecting the mainland with the group of islands that comprise the historic center of Venice.
